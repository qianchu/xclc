# XCLC

In this work, we present XCLC, a wide-coverage and carefully designed cross-lingual and multilingual evaluation set; it aims to assess the ability of state-of-the-art representation models to reason over cross-lingual lexical-level concept alignment in context for 14 language pairs. Compared to related tasks such as [WiC](https://pilehvar.github.io/wic/) and [XL-WiC](https://pilehvar.github.io/xlwic/), our dataset offers

1. wide coverage of **diverse languages** and unique words
2. higher quality with **higher human performance** (around 90\%, compared with 80\% in WiC and XL-WiC)
3. **more challenges** as we introduce 'same context different word' adversarial examples
4. explicit **cross-lingual** alignment evaluation

## Languages

English (EN), German (DE), Russian (RU), Japanese (JA), Korean (KO), Mandarin Chinese(ZH), Arabic(AR), Indonesian(IN), Finnish(FI), Turkish(TR), Basque(EU), Georgian(KA), Urdu(UR), Bengali(BN), Kazakh(KK).

## Data format
You will find train, dev and test tsv files in each language folder in `./data`. A data example consists of two word in context instances coming from English and another target language. The system needs to predict whether the two target words in context have the same meaning ("T") or not ("F"). Below are some examples from the ZH train.tsv:
